  abstract  = "Ant Colony System (ACS) is a well known metaheuristic algorithm for solving difficult optimization problems inspired by the foraging behaviour of social insects (ants). Artificial ants in the ACS cooperate indirectly through deposition of pheromone trails on the edges of the problem representation graph. All trails comprise a pheromone memory. In this paper we extend the previous work on a novel selective pheromone memory model for the ACS in which pheromone values are stored only for the selected subset of trails. Results of the experiments conducted on several Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP) instances show that it is possible to significantly reduce the ACS memory requirements without impairing the quality of the solutions.",

abstract="The purpose of this paper is to provide a preliminary report on the first broad-based experimental comparison of modern heuristics for the asymmetric traveling salesmen problem (ATSP). There are currently three general classes of such heuristics: classical tour construction heuristics such as Nearest Neighbor and the Greedy algorithm, local search algorithms based on re-arranging segments of the tour, as exemplified by the Kanellakis-Papadimitriou algorithm [KP80], and algorithms based on patching together the cycles in a minimum cycle cover, the best of which are variants on an algorithm proposed by Zhang [Zha93]. We test implementations of the main contenders from each class on a variety of instance types, introducing a variety of new random instance generators modeled on real-world applications of the ATSP. Among the many tentative conclusions we reach is that no single algorithm is dominant over all instance classes, although for each class the best tours are found either by Zhang's algorithm or an iterated variant on Kanellakis-Papadimitriou.",
